						<div class="content">
							<strong>What is the Nintendo Vs. System?</strong>
							<p>The Nintendo VS. System is an arcade system developed and produced by Nintendo, first released in 1984. It is an arcade hardware that is based on that of the Nintendo Entertainment System, containing much of the console's chips and processors within. All games released for the system are ports of NES games, some being heavily altered to accommodate for the hardware. The system had a heavy focus on two-player cooperative play. The system was released in three different configurations - upright "VS. UniSystem" cabinets, upright "VS. DualSystem cabinets", and sit-down "VS. DualSystem" cabinets. Games are on chips that can be plugged into the board, allowing for one side to have a different game than the other. [source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_VS._System">wikipedia</a>]</p>
							<strong>Do I need a real arcade cabinet to play Vs. From Below?</strong>
							<p>No, you can play it in any emulator that supports Vs. System. <a href="https://www.mesen.ca/">Mesen</a> (free) is recommended for best compatibility. It is likely also
							works in Mame, but it has not been tested.</p>
							<strong>What is the difference between Vs. From Below, and From Below [NES]?</strong>
							<p>They are essentially the same game at their core. The Vs. version has been updated to function like an authentic arcade game. See above for a full list of changes.</p>
							<strong>Which Vs. System PPUs are support?</strong>
							<p>All 6 Vs. PPUs are supported for the same ROM. Switching between PPU is done via dipswitches.</p>
							<strong>Which Vs. Systems are supported (Dual, UniSystem, Upright, etc)?</strong>
							<p>All confirgurations should work.</p>
							<strong>Will Vs. From Below ever be ported to NES cartridge?</strong>
							<p>Hopefully, yes! It is setup in such a way that the software will work out of the box, but it needs special carts that expose dipswitches.</p>
